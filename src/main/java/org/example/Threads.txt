Problems than can be caused by using threads:
    Concurrency
        - This occurs when two or more threads are trying to modify a shared data or object without the knowledge that the other thread are doing the same.

    DeadLock
        - This occurs when, two threads have the keys of each other that allows them to enter a method. This leads to a standstill.

    Immutables
        - If you want a variable that cannot be changed or modified, mark it as an immutable.
        - Make an object immutable if you’re going to
          share it between threads and you don’t want the
          threads to change its data.
        - You can change immutable data just by referencing or pointing it to a new data.

    ConcurrentModificationException
        - To combat this, we can use the data structures provided by the concurrent package. An example is the CopyOnWriteArrayList which when two threads simultaneously reads and writes a file, the CopyOnWriteArrayList creates a copy of the original list so that the two threads work separately and when the other thread is finished, the duplicate list becomes the original list.
