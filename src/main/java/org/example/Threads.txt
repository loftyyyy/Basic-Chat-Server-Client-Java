Problems than can be caused by using threads:
    Concurrency
        - This occurs when two or more threads are trying to modify a shared data or object without the knowledge that the other thread are doing the same.

    DeadLock
        - This occurs when, two threads have the keys of each other that allows them to enter a method. This leads to a standstill.
